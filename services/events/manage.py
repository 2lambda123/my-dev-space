Many UK therapists, mental health nurses, teachers, health professionals and counsellors who have been through this course in the past have found it very useful to their work and personal development. You can read some of their testimonials below. The course is quality-checked by the\u00a0National Counselling Society and can count towards your CPD requirements.\u00a0CPD certificate will be issued on the day.\nSufferers: If you are a sufferer, you can also attend for this course. As an ex-anxiety sufferer myself, the course is designed not only to help the professionals sharpen their skills but also to enable sufferers to get their hands on a simple but effective recovery model to achieve personal transformation. You will learn about the steps that helped me transform my anxiety disorder, allowing me to start helping others around the world achieve similar life-changing transformation. The course environment is relaxed and reassuring, and you will be able to share your story with me if you want to, and ask questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Noted Benefits of Using the F.E.A.R Model\nThe following benefits have been gathered from both the sufferers and professionals who have used the F.E.A.R model either as a self-help tool or as a model for helping clients:\n\nHealth and fitness.\u00a0The FEAR Model helps restore the body to function as intended. Emotional stress and anxiety messes up the nervous\u00a0system,\u00a0increases emotional fatigue and degenerates the body quickly. By using the FEAR model steps regularly, you\u2019ll achieve heightened emotional well-being , a\u00a0higher level of energy, creativity, and greater life satisfaction. A sufferer who recently went through the course wrote the following feedback, \u201cVery good, informative, eye and mind opening. I wish I had known all that 20 years ago. It would have made my life much easier and successful.\u201d Also, since anxiety and stress often speed\u00a0up body degeneration, looking a lot younger has also been noted among regular users of the FEAR model steps. The FEAR Model steps can also be adapted to bring about natural weight loss by transforming the emotional and mental pathways that reinforce\u00a0weight-gain in the brain.\nPersonal transformation.\u00a0The FEAR model takes you or your client to a new, higher level regarding emotional wellbeing, work, relationship and makes you a different person in many ways. We become what we think about all the time. Once your thought-life has been transformed, life transformation is inevitable. A course attendee shared this testimonial\u00a0 recently. \u201cI am a\u00a0mum\u00a0of an anxious teenager (OCD). I now have a few more tools in my kit bag. Thought provoking. Simple techniques for what may be complex problems, but doable steps to recovery.\u201d\nPersonal Growth,\u00a0Influence\u00a0and Recognition. If you are a therapist in practice, most clients that will come to you are more likely to have received two or more therapy interventions in the past. They have come to you to see if you offer anything different and long-lasting from what they have experienced in the past. Mastering The FEAR model sets you apart from the pack by offering your clients a simple system that offers transformation and long-lasting effect than they have experienced in the past. This builds credibility, recognition and expands your practice, as a very happy client often tells as least 3 other prospects. Your clients will value and respect you more for your helpful insight and attention to details. All of these benefits come as a result of your desire for personal growth to explore the FEAR model. \u201cThe course was extremely helpful and informative. Interesting, excellent and enjoyable. It enables me to help so many adults and children within the support groups I run,\u201d J. Morgan, Parent Rep and Support Group Facilitator\nIt saves money and increases practice turn-over.\u00a0Many sufferers who have gone through the FEAR model course wished they had attended the course many years ago, as this would have saved them not just a lot of money but also time and a lot of emotional and physical pain. As a therapist in practice, we know that word of mouth is the most effective advertising tool especially for therapists in practice. This can translate to more organic referrals from transformed and happy clients, leading to the\u00a0increase in your turn-over as a practitioner.\n\n\nWhat Previous Attendees Were Saying:\n\n\"Very good...informative, useful - well worth attending.\" -- Dr C.

Relationships are very important. In a live event like this, there is ample opportunity to connect with like-minded people, share experiences, get motivated and discover what is working for others. I have been able to meet and connect with some amazing people in events such as this one.\nThe second reason why this is a subsidised event is the\u00a0feedback\u00a0that we get from our attendees. This is extremely useful. It helps us improve our courses and get better in serving others.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT\nAll you need to do is to register your ticket to attend this event now.\u00a0 The event is expected to be oversubscribed as there are very limited spaces. So book your seat now.\n\nIntroduction:\nGeneralised anxiety and panic disorder are often two of the easily noticeable signs of deep-seated issues. And if not treated properly, more complicated anxiety disorder outlets are inevitable. Studies have shown that nearly a quarter of the adult population will suffer from an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. Yet only a small percentage of these people actually receive effective treatments that deal with the root causes of anxiety and panic disorders. Perhaps, you yourself as a therapist or client, have seen people who have been through most of the mainstream anxiety recovery programmes with little or no improvement. The real epidemic is not the disorder itself, but our inability to provide adequate recovery treatment that focuses on unearthing the underlying root causes and permanently transforming the sufferers.In an era where too much attention has been given to antidepressants prescriptions and on the coping mechanisms that temporarily numb the symptoms as opposed to eliminating them, there is a vital need for a recovery programme that promises transformation, which every anxiety patient in our societies deserves. \nHopefully, you will be able to join us for this event.I look forward to seeing you there,Best regardsWale OladipoLead Coach & Therapist, Mind Body Breakthrough\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nCancellation:\nCancellation charges are applied in all cases.

        "description": "CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. Farset Labs\u2019 CoderDojo is run by volunteers from the Farset community and offers a range of computer skills, from web application development to scratch.\nAt a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they\u2019ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.\nCoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: \u201cAbove All: Be Cool\u201c, bullying, lying, wasting people\u2019s time and so on is uncool.\nIt also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don\u2019t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!\nFor more information about Coder Dojo, check out the\u00a0CoderDojo global webpage.\nYou can also follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\n\nWhat should I bring to the event?\nIf you can, please bring your own laptop.\nCan I join as a mentor/volunteer?\nYes! We always appreciate more hands on deck, but we do need to put people through a short induction/training programme first, so get in touch with us on\u00a0dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk\u00a0and we can add you to the next induction stream.\nI can\u2019t make it, what can I do to help?\nIf you can\u2019t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at\u00a0BMC in Belfast,Ballymena, or the brand new Dojo in\u00a0Newry.\nIf you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a\u00a0donation\u00a0to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.\nIs there an age limit to enter the event?\nCoderDojo is aimed loosely at the under 18\u2019s, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and that guardian must stay on-site for the duration of the event\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nWe\u2019re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus\nIs there a charge for the event\nFarset Labs\u2019 members operate the CoderDojo for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.\nWhat Child Protection Policies are in place?\nOnly those registered may attend, including mentors. For full details, see\u00a0Farset Labs\u2019 Child Protection Policy. At the lead mentors\u2019 discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space.",

Your name will be on our guest list.\n\u00a0\nCan I update my registration information?\nYes, please email lucy@onlyjustmedia.com with your updated info.\n\u00a0\nIs it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?\nUnfortunately this is not okay. To make this event as special as it is, we are working to cater directly to each individual who buys a ticket. Please insure that the name on the ticket/registration matches who is attending.\n\nWhy is there a no-refund policy?\nOnce we receive information on who is attending this event, we begin our 'match-making process' (this means matching influencers with brands / brands with influencers. We are designing our event based on those who are attending. This is naturally very time consuming, so no-refunds can be issued once a ticket has been purchased.\n\u00a0",

In this talk we look at how security principles can be applied to container-based deployments at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, and show an example of a practical security-related action that you can take at each stage.\"</p> <p>There will also be a few demos including microscanner and a little bit on Aqua runtime as well.</p> <p>This is our last Meetup until September and I believe it's Liz's first time speaking in Dublin so please join us in welcoming Liz to our Meetup!</p> <p>See you all on July 26th!</p> <p>A huge thank you to our sponsors Workday and Riot Games!!</p> <p>Rgds,<br/>Tom and Dave</p>",
